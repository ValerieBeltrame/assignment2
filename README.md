This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To start up the project:
1. Run `npm install`
2. Insert the database-user name and password into the mongoose connection string in the `server.js` (line 10)
3. Run `npm run start-dev`. The api can then be accessed under http://localhost:3001/api.
